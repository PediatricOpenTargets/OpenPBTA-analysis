## Steps for creating subset files for GitHub Actions CI

1. Update to the most recent release of the data by running `bash download-data.sh` in the root directory of the repository.
2. Run the shell script to generate subset files (from the root directory of the repository):

```
RELEASE=<RELEASE> ./analyses/create-subset-files/create_subset_files.sh
```
Alternatively, change the default value for `RELEASE` in the shell script.

3. The files in `data/testing/<RELEASE>` are now ready to be uploaded to S3.

### Overview of approach

The objective of this module is to create files that are used in continuous integration to save on the amount of time it takes to download files and run analyses as well as reducing the amount of RAM that is required.

We create these files by randomly selecting participants that are represented in each file. 
The number of matched participants (participants that will be represented in _all_ files in CI) is controlled by the `--num_matched` to `01-get_biospecimen_identifiers.R` (Rscript default is `25`) and the `NUM_MATCHED` environmental variable in `create_subset_files.sh` (the default is `15` and therefore this is the default for the module).
Non-matched samples are also added to each file (10% of `--num_matched`), which allows us to test the realistic scenario where a participant ID is in one file but not another.

Some files are copied over in their entirety (e.g., BED files).
See `create_subset_files.sh` for more information.

Note: `splice-events-rmats.tsv.gz` and all `methyl*` files are skipped in v13 due to large size and that no modules currently routinely utilize these files.

#### Special considerations

Certain analysis modules have required modifications to the subset file creation steps beyond randomly selecting participants.

* We have four RNA-seq datasets, `stranded`, `poly-A stranded`, `poly-A`, and `exome_capture`. Participant are selected proportional to the composition of RNA-Seq libraries in each cohort.
* [`sex-prediction-from-RNASeq`](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/sex-prediction-from-RNASeq) required that we specified `Male` and `Female` samples (`reported_gender`). We stratify the subset data based on the proportions of `reported_gender` in each cohort where applicable. All cohorts are approximately balanced in gender composition (as of v11 data release) except for `GTEx` where sample for `Female` participants are ~50% of those for `Male` participants.
* `tp53_nf1_module` requires us to include a set of biospecimen IDs for samples that have _TP53_ mutations and are present in the `stranded` RNA-seq dataset.
See the `00-enrich-tp53-nf1-score-examples.Rmd` notebook for more information.
* `fusion-summary` requires us to include _FGFR1--TACC1_, _MYB--QKI_, fusions or fusions that involve _BRAF_, _MN1_, _RELA_, or _EWSR1_.
* `rnaseq-batch-correct` requires us to include _MYCN amp_ and _MYCN non-amp_ Neuroblastoma subtypes and _Diffuse midline glioma_ and _High-grade glioma/astrocytoma_ `cancer groups` balanced for RNA-Seq library types (`stranded`, `poly-A`, and `ploy-A stranded`) for `tumor-only` batch correction. In addition, _Brain Cortex_ and _Brain Cerebellum_ normal samples are required for `tumor-normal` batch correction.
See the `00-enrich-batch-correction-examples.Rmd` notebook for more information.
* `methylation-summary` requires us to include samples for patients with both methylation and RNA-Seq data in order to compute the correlation between methylation and RNA-Seq.
See the `00-enrich-methy-rnaseq-examples.Rmd` notebook for more information.

### Local development

Some of the SNV files are quite large and are not amenable to subsetting with less than 128 GB of RAM.

To skip the larger MAF file (`consensus with hotspots`), you can set the `--local` option of `01-get_biospecimen_identifiers.R` to `1`. 

To run the entire pipeline with skipping those files enabled, one can run (from the root directory of the repository):

```
RUN_LOCAL=1 ./analyses/create-subset-files/create_subset_files.sh
```

### Additional features for convenience

Running the following from the root directory of the repository

```
SKIP_SUBSETTING=1 ./analyses/create-subset-files/create_subset_files.sh
```

will skip the subsetting file steps that are implemented in R and only copy files that are included in full (e.g., `histologies.tsv`) and generate a new `md5sum.txt`.
This is intended to be used when the only files that need to be updated are those that are copied over without being reduced in size in anyway.
