# OpenPedCan Methylation Analysis

## Purpose

Preprocess probe hybridization intensity values of selected methylated and unmethylated cytosine (CpG) loci into usable methylation measurements for the [Pediatric Open Targets, OPenPedCan-analysis](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis) raw DNA methylation array datasets. 

## Data description 

#### TARGET
The TARGET Illumina `Infinium HumanMethylation (27k, 450k and 27k) BeadChip` and `Roche Nimblegen HELP` methylation arrays and sample metadata for the following pediatric cancers were downloaded from the [TARGET project website](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/target-methods):
 
- [Neuroblastoma (NBL)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/NBL/methylation_array/) - `Infinium HumanMethylation450`
- [Osteosarcoma (OS)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/OS/methylation_array/) - `Infinium HumanMethylation450`
- [Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/CCSK/methylation_array/) - `Infinium HumanMethylation450`
- [Wilms Tumor (WT)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/WT/methylation_array/) - `Infinium HumanMethylation450`
- [Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/AML/methylation_array/) - `Infinium HumanMethylation450 and Infinium HumanMethylation27`
- [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)](https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/ALL/methylation_array/Phase2/) - `Nimblegen HELP methylation`

###  Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN)
The [Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN)](https://cbtn.org/) `Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC (850k) BeadChip` methylation arrays and sample metadata for several Pediatric brain tumors.

## Analysis

- The TARGET Illumina methylation analysis results available on the [TARGET project website](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/target-methods) were preprocessed with different methylation software packages, including `GenomeStudio` (AML27k), `minfi` (AML450k), `BeadStudio` (CCSK and WT), `methylumi` (NBL), and `Lumi+BMIQ` (OS). We have preprocessed all the TARGET and CBTN cancer types with Illumina arrays and using the updated version of [minfi Bioconductor package](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/4/558/2666344). We utilized the `preprocessQuantile` array preprocessing method implemented in minfi for background correction, removing of outlier samples, and performing stratified quantile normalization to estimate the relative abundance of methylated and unmethylated cytosines at selected loci (Beta and M values). Using the one prepprocessing method for all datasets from the same array platform/vendor allows downstream comparisons of methylation profiles across cancer type.
- There is a small subset of `non-tumor (normal)` samples in both datasets representing a few cancer types that could protentially be utlized as a control set for other downstream comparative analyses.
- Unlike the probe annotations Illumina 450k and 850k arrays, the probe annotations for older Illumina 27k arrays do not specify methylation region relative to gene coding loci (TSS or body) and are therefore not reported in the summary results. Since CpG sites interogated by the Illumina 27k array probes are a subset of Illumina 450k array probes, the methylation regions of the former can be easily be inferred from the latter for common samples among the two. 
- The TARGET `Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)` array dataset is from a different array platform and vendor, `Nimblegen HELP (Roche)` has not been reanalyzed.
- All sample array data files have been renamed using their respective OpenPedCan sample IDs (`Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID`) for consistency in this analysis module.
- Reported results have been filtered to exclude array probes without annotation information.
- Some metadata input (sample manifests) are provided in a complete file and multiple subdivided files. Users can subdivide the complete metadata file using some criteria (i.e., cancer types, run groups) into batches that can be preprocessed successfully on their resources if they don't have access to a large memory machine to preprocess the dataset in one batch. The batch results are eventually merged by the module pipeline script, `run-preprocess-illumina-arrays.sh` after the analysis run is completed. The pipeline script will need to be amended depending on the number of batches a particular user has 


## General usage of scripts


#### `run-preprocess-illumina-arrays.sh`
This is a bash script wrapper for setting input file paths for the main analysis script, `01-preprocess-illumina-arrays.R` All file paths set in this script relative to the module directory. Therefore, this script should always run as if it were being called from the directory it lives in, the module directory (`OpenPedCan-analysis/analyses/methylation-analysis`).

```
bash run-preprocess-illumina-arrays.sh
```

#### `01-preprocess-illumina-arrays.R`
Preprocesses raw Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation BeadArrays (27K, 450K, and 850k) intensities using `minfi Bioconductor package` into usable methylation measurements (Beta and M values) for TARGET normal and tumor samples. 
- `BiocManager::install("minfi")`

Addition data packages for `Ilumina Infinium HumanMethylation 27k and 850k BeadArrays` that don't get installed automatically with `minfi`  and will need to be installed separately as folllows:
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylation27kmanifest")`
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylation450kmanifest")`
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICmanifest")`
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylation27kanno.ilmn12.hg19")`
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19")`
- `BiocManager::install("IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b4.hg19")`


In some `Ububtu OS` flavors, error occurs from the `preprocessCore library` is installed by `BiocManger` when `minfi` calls the normalization functions. The workaround is to [disable threading](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/122925/) as shown below. This is not an issue on Mac and Redhat OS. 
- `BiocManager::install("preprocessCore", configure.args="--disable-threading", force = TRUE)`

## High Performance Computing (HPC)

In addition to the base scripts, this module contains the necessary components
to perform the more resource intensive steps remotely using Docker, Common
Workflow Language (CWL), and CAVATICA.

### Docker

This module contains a Dockerfile. That Dockerfile is used for running pieces
of this module in a CWL environment. The image generated by the Dockerfile is
stored on DockerHub, and it is provided here for reference. If you wish to
build the Dockerfile yourself, use the following command substituting in your
desired `image_name` and `image_version`:
`docker build -t <image_name>:<image_version> .`

### Common Workflow Language (CWL)

In this module, there are two folders containing CWL files: `tools` and
`workflows`. The tools directory contains many files that contain the necessary
information to build the command lines for the various commands used to
preprocess the Illumina Methylation IDAT files. The `workflows` directory
contains CWL workflows. Workflows act as wrappers for the CWL tools. Workflows
define what the user is allowed to hand in to the workflow, what the user will
receive as an output, and how intermediate files and/or values are passed
between the tools.

### CAVATICA

To use the above tools or workflow(s), the user must upload them to CAVATICA.
To do that, the user must download scripts and publish an application.
Following command can be used to publish an application on CAVATICA:
`sbpack <sbg profile>  <user>/<projectname>/<workflowname> <path/to/workflow.cwl>`
Refer to this link for instructions on setting up [sbpack](https://docs.cavatica.org/docs/maintaining-and-versioning-cwl-on-external-tool-repositories).
