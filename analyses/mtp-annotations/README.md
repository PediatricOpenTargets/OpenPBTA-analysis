# MTP Open Targets Diseases and Targets Annotations
This analysis is DEPRECATED and was last run with OpenPedCan data release `v12`.

David Hill and Eric Wafula

## Generating diseases and targets mapping files
This module transforms Open Targets Platform `Target` (core annotations for targets) and `Disease/Phenotype` (core annotations for diseases and phenotypes) tables into mapping files utilized in filtering MTP disgnated tables and OpenPedCan data release files for plotting API development.

## Module structure

1) The bash script,` run-mtp-annotations.sh` creates temporary directories in the file structure below to download `MTP Open Targets Platform` `targets` files to `scratch/mtp-json/targets/` and `disease` files to `scratch/mtp-json/diseases/`. The bash script is also converts downloaded JSON files to CSV format and executes the annotions mapping R script, `01-mtp-annotations.R`. 

2) The R script,` 01-mtp-annotations.R` created the required module outputs, `mtp-targets-mapping.tsv` and `mtp-diseases-mapping.tsv` written to the module `results/` directory.
