## Output Tables for OpenPedCan Manuscripts

This Rmarkdown generates tables used in the manuscript, including both main text and supplementary material. 

```{r define directories and result files}
root_dir <- rprojroot::find_root(rprojroot::has_dir(".git"))
working_dir <- file.path(root_dir, "tables")
input_dir <- file.path(working_dir, "input")
analyses_dir <- file.path(root_dir, "analyses")
# Define data_dir based on ci. The `testing` param covers if we are in CI where 1 is CI.
if (params$release == "testing") {
  data_dir <- file.path(root_dir, "data")
} else {
  data_dir <- file.path(root_dir, "data", params$release)
}
results_dir <- file.path(working_dir, "results")
if(!dir.exists(results_dir)){
  dir.create(results_dir, recursive=TRUE)
}
```


# Define input files
```{r}
histology_file <- file.path(data_dir, "histologies.tsv")
```

# Define output files and sheet names, when appropriate
```{r}
table_s1_file <- file.path(results_dir, "TableS1-histologies.xlsx")
```

# Read files
```{r}
histology_df <- read_tsv(histology_file, guess_max =10000)
```
